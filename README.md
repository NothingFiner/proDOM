proDOM is a lightweight library, inspired by jQuery, with DOM manipulation so good it hurts.

With proDOM you can:
  * Select any amount of DOM Elements using a variety of selectors
  * Traverse and manipulate those Elements
  * Append or replace elements in the DOM
  * Queue functions to be executed after the DOM finishes loading
  * Simplify AJAX requests
